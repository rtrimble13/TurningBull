  <section class="post">
    <p>I’d like to ask you to channel your inner Goethe for a moment and envision yourself as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice">Sorcerer</a>.  That’s right: the stern old guy with a full beard and a moon hat.  It doesn’t have to be an old man, though.  Use your imagination - to the point of this segment, the <em>details don’t matter.</em>  Are we good?  So, you’re the Sorcerer, and you have an apprentice.  The apprentice can be a boy, a girl, even a mouse.  It doesn’t matter.  Remember, we’re engaging in magical thought and the details do <em>not</em> matter.  What if things had turned out differently, though?  What if you hadn’t spent the full day conjuring solutions to a massive set of domestic economic issues and geopolitical crises.  After all, just one of these problems could require the efforts of multiple sorcerers, let alone the full basket of them.  What if you hadn’t exhaused yourself after so much toiling that you would have thought twice about leaving your apprentice unsupervised.</p>

<p>Look at him, though, your apprentice.  “He’s just a boy (or girl, or mouse),” you would have thought to yourself.  “What true harm could he (she, it) really inflict?”  Perhaps if you hadn’t been so worn out from a hard day’s work you would have rememberd your Lord Acton from your Sorcery University days.  Isn’t he the one who warned about absolute power?  Looking around your lair, though, it was a mess of half-conjured spells, failed attempts, and invoices for raw materials.  So much to do when you’re a Sorcerer, and you probably bristled at the thought of returning to this sty in the morning and finding it in the condition in which you left it.  And so, in your exhaustion it’s understandable that you’d leave it to your apprentice to do the sorting.</p>

<p>Well, what if you had put your spell books just out of reach?  You know, the 3rd edition abridged <em>Wizard’s Guide</em>, with Gandolf’s personal autograph.  Your prized <em>Learning C++ for Fun and Profit</em> would not have posed a risk.  You could have left it open to the chapter on working with raw pointers without a second thought.  But, you should have thought twice about the magic book, perhaps.  Probably that one should have gone in the safe before you doffed your moon hat and dotted off to bed.</p>

<p>That is how it played out, though.  With access to your spells, your apprentice assumed that you had issued a mandate: fix this mess.  Can you picture it now, after seeing the result?  Your apprentice, recklessly flipping through the pages, looking for a shortcut to make the lair clean again.  Spitting out some words in the wrong tone; in some cases leaving key words out, and in others injecting random phrases.  With a large enough imagination, I’ll bet you can even picture the electricity in the air as your apprentice gave legs to the broom.  No, not the mop in the closet; the broom.  Don’t ask where the broom was - details don’t matter, remember!  And, can you picture the look on your apprentice’s face as he finally took an ax to the broom.  Perhaps that look was a mixture of sly-eyed hubris and despair.  Later, when your apprentice recounted these events while dripping with water and redirecting the blame at you, you might start to doubt yourself.  You even may ask youself if, in all your years of wizarding, you had even considered how to animate a broom, not to mention cause one to multiply and deliver endless buckets of water to your lair.  It wouldn’t really matter now, though.  The damage had been done.  Even your C++ book suffered too much water damage to be useful.</p>

<p><img src="/TurningBull/images/posts/apr25/apprentice2.png" alt="The Apprentice" /></p>

<p>Events could have turned out differently.  Perhaps with a little more care, tomorrow could have been just another day of conjuring solutions to the world’s problems.  Perhaps that would have been a better outcome than instead struggling to undo the mess your apprentice left behind.  What if it had been different?  What if we had all done with a little less magical thinking?</p>

<h3 id="the-magical-month-of-april">The Magical Month of April</h3>

<p><img src="/TurningBull/images/posts/apr25/us10y.png" alt="Bond Selloff" /></p>

<p>This bizarre allegory was inspired by the true events of April, 2025.  Honestly, it was a toss-up between <em>The Sorcerer’s Apprentice</em> and <em>The Cat in the Hat.</em>  Both seem apt.  Following a mind-numbing March that saw the U.S. take bold steps in the opposite direction from the liberal world order it helped to build after the Second World War, April began with wild U.S.-led alchemy.  The much anticipated tariff strategy was unveiled in the afternoon of April 2nd.  With so much written on it already, I won’t go too far into the weeds here except to summarize it as a 10% base rate + an additional variable rate levied on all of our trading partners resulting in tariffs against some countries approaching 50%.  One could describe it as bananas.  Magical bananas, since the mathematical/economic logic behind the rate setting was highly unorthodox.  The following two days saw a sell-off in stocks and an initial <em>flight to safety</em> in U.S. Treasuries.  However, that flight to safety started to fizzle as the world went back to work the following Monday.  The yield on the 10-Year Treasury Note climbed from 3.9% to 4.5% when tariffs were paused in time for lunch on Wednesday the 9th.  By Friday, that yield had inched in 10 more basis points to hit 4.6%, signaling continued sell-off of Treasuries.  Since then, at least up to the time of this writing, the administration has continued to mop up the flooded lair.  It was a lot of water, though, and probably a fair bit of damage that will be hard to repair.</p>

<p>Let’s pick this apart some.  First, by repeating three of the stated reasons for launching a trade war:</p>

<p><strong>Claim 1:</strong> America is being ripped off by our trading partners, so tariffs are a <em>retaliatory</em> measure to fight back.</p>

<p><strong>Claim 2:</strong> Tariffs are a source of revenue and will help reduce the national debt.</p>

<p><strong>Claim 3:</strong> Tariffs will help rekindle America’s manufacturing capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>(1)</strong> is supported by the framing of the April 2nd tariffs as retaliatory as well as the convoluted methodology of setting variable rates for each U.S. trading partner as something close to:</p>

\[\frac{Net\ Exports}{Total\ Imports} \times 0.5\]

<p>The problem with this formula is that it is not grounded in economic logic.  To say that the trade deficit with another country divided by the total amount we import from that country represents an imbalance is a stretch.  An example posed by <strong>The Economist</strong> illustrates the absurdity.  In 2024, the America imported $405MM from Botswanna, primarily in <em>duty-free</em> diamonds, as that is one of their main exports.  America exported $104MM, leading to a net deficit for the U.S. of $301MM.  The resulting 37% tariff \((=\frac{\$301}{\$405} \times 0.5)\) presumably addresses an unfair trade practice.  To solve this problem, it seems that either Botswanna can buy an additional $300MM of goods from us, whatever that is, or we can ramp up our domestic diamond mining industry.  Either way, one of the effects is that Americans end up paying a lot more for diamonds.</p>

<p>On <strong>(2)</strong>, the logic is also a little magical.  To believe that the revenue earned on tariffs will make a dent in the national debt, and possibly allow the administration to reduce tax rates, assumes imposing tariffs doesn’t otherwise affect trade.  However, there is a fairly well understood effect of tariffs that goes a little like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tax on imports increases the cost of goods, causing Americans to spend less.</li>
  <li>Lower American consumption causes companies to import fewer foreign goods.</li>
  <li>Lower U.S. company purchasing leads to fewer dollars in circulation.</li>
  <li>Lower supply of dollars leads to higher demand to swap for foreign currency, which leads to a stronger dollar.</li>
  <li>A stronger dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive to foreign companies.</li>
</ol>

<p>The end effect is a tax on exports along with imports, or a double tax.  It’s difficult to see how Americans win in this scenario.  To cap this mini analysis, between <strong>(1)</strong> and <strong>(2)</strong>, there is an apparent contradiction.  If the motivation for a trade war is to address unfair trade practices, then we’re to assume the administration’s end goal is to renegnotiate trade deals with all of the world’s countries.  Yes, that includes renegotiating USMCA, presumably.  However, if the goal is also to reduce debt with bountiful tariff revenue, then renegotiating trade deals seems to be off the mark.  We’ll never know, but perhaps this is where magical thinking can help.</p>

<p><strong>(3)</strong> also seems a bit far-fetched.  By definition, tariffs are protectionary.  They disincentivize foreign investment in favor of domestic.  An effect of this protection of domestic industry, though, is a reduction in competitiveness.  Companies that are protected have less incentive to innovate.  Over time the measurable effect is higher prices for lower productivity.  Look no further than America’s defense contractors for cases in point.  Further, the evidence for tariffs reducing taxpayer expenses is also thin.  Take agricultural tariffs implemented in 2017, for instance.  To make America’s farmers whole in the midst of the president’s first term, Uncle Sam bailed them out in the form of farm subsidies.  I’ll admit my negative view of tariffs.  However, across the three publically stated motivations for them, it is just seems really difficult to build a coherent argument in their favor.</p>

<p>Let’s transition to the Treasury market reaction.  In my view this was much more interesting than the equity market one.  I can hear that scoff - here’s why.  As depicted in the 10-Year Treasury chart, the tariff announcement drove an initial reduction in bond yields.  Market analysts typically describe this phenomenon as a flight to safety.  When investors get spooked, they often reduce their exposure to <em>risky</em> assets, such as stocks, and divert their cash to assets that are considered to be <em>risk free,</em> such as U.S. Treasuries.  This is because U.S. government debt is historically considered one of the safest areas to invest, since it is backed by the government’s implied promise that it will never default.  So, investors fleeing to safety buy Treasuries, and just as buying stocks pushes up their prices in accordance with the laws of supply and demand, the same happens to <em>risk-free</em> bonds.  As Treasury prices rise, their yields decrease.</p>

<p>The interesting happened on the World’s Monday morning walk to the office.  Global investors started thinking about that <em>risk-free</em> quality of U.S. debt.  After all, we’re not living in our parents’ America anymore.  This is no longer just an America with an addiction to debt, it is also an America that seems to be playing with fire: making crazy incantations, flailing its wand all over the place, and jeopordizing its future growth prospects.  Naturally, as investors are witnessing what appears to be a train wreck in motion, they come to the reasonable conclusion that Treasuries may not be the safe haven they used to be.  So, they start unloading U.S. bonds.  And that explains an upward climb in yields.</p>

<p>That alone would be interesting enough, but the real kicker is that the yield on the 10-Year Treasury Note climbed from 3.9% to 4.5% in just a few days.  This is a massive move in such a short time frame, and it was driven by a single event: the tariff announcement.  The market’s reaction was so swift and severe that it suggests that investors were not only reacting to the immediate implications of the tariffs, but also to the broader implications for U.S. economic policy and stability.  This is where we can see the true power of magical thinking at work.</p>

<h3 id="deficits-and-debt">Deficits and Debt</h3>

<p>Exploring this a little further, let’s dig into some numbers to help illustrate the problem.  According to the Treasury Department, the government collected $4.9Tn in revenue in 2024.  About 49% of it ($2.4Tn) came from individual income taxes.  The next largest source of revenue was payroll taxes, which accounted for about 36% ($1.8Tn).  Corporate income taxes made up about 7% ($350Bn), and the remaining 8% ($400Bn) came from various other sources, including tariffs, estate taxes, and excise taxes.  Notably, tariffs accounted for less than 2%.  In subcribing to the belief that tariffs can become a major player as a source of revenue, there is a lot of ground it must cover to reach parity with coporate taxes, let alone individual income tax.  Again, for that to happen, one needs to assume the administration can fiddle with tariff rates without impacting other things, such as the quanitity of imports and exports.</p>

<p>On the other side of the ledger, the government spent $6.8Tn in 2024.  Outlays are either manadatory, as in spending the government must undertake by law to support various things, such as entitlement programs, or discretionary, which is spending that can be adjusted based on annual budget decisions.  Roughly 2/3rds ($4.6Tn) of spending is mandatary.  Of the $2.2Tn of discretionary spend, more than half of it is spent on defense.  The remaining discretionary spending is allocated to various programs, including foreign aid, education, transportation, scientific and environmental research, and national parks.  It is this slice of the discretionary pie that has been notably in the administration’s sights: ~1.1Tn, or 16% of the budget.  Conincidentally, this amount is just shy - by $200Bn - of what the government spent on debt interest in 2024.  I think the main takeaway here is, for all the administration’s claims that it can meaningfully cut the size of the budget with tools, such as the DOGE hatchet, there are major limits to what it can accomplish without seriously taking on entitlement programs and defense spending.</p>

<p>So, if the government took in $4.9Tn in 2024, and spent $6.8Tn, that leaves us with a deficit of $1.9Tn.  The annual deficit varies year over year.  The Covid Pandemic and a 20-year couple of wars led to increased deficits.  The last time we had a surplus was when Clinton was in office - a remarkably bipartisan time in American politics by today’s standards.  When the government runs a deficit it does what any rational person would do and borrows money.  Yes, that’s an attempt at a joke..  Over time, the total outstanding government debt has grown to $36Tn, or roughly 124% of GDP.  This has a lot of folks worried, especially when you consider the amount in interest payments ($1.3Tn in 2024) required to service that debt.  Debt service is a manadatory outlay, so long as we don’t want to find ourselves in the same peer group as Argentina.  And so long as America continues to spend at greater rates than we take in, we will continue to take from the future to live for today.  Complicating the picture with tariffs adds to the unease.  As we’ve discussed, it is not clear that tariffs will meaningfully increase revenues - it is more likely that trade will reduce.  And protecting domestic industry will lead to increased spending on subsidies while reducing consumer consumption - due to higher prices and lower productivity.  The long-term sustainability is questionable, and investors are right to be nervous.</p>

<h3 id="taking-interest-in-interest-rates">Taking Interest in Interest Rates</h3>

<p>One last brush stroke to paint this rosy picture.  For much of the last decade interest rates have been at historic lows.  When you’re paying back a loan at a low interest rate, the amount you’re borrowing is less important, to an exent.  This is because, especially if you are the largest economy and are leading the world’s liberal order, then there are presumably plenty of opportunities to earn a higher return on investment for the money you are borrowing.  Yes, that statement is slightly Pollyannish, but theoretically not far off the mark.  However, when interest rates rise, then then next time you have to go to the market to borrow money, you’re doing so at a greater cost.  Borrowing at a greater cost means your interest expense, or debt servicing costs, are higher.</p>

<p>For instance, if you, the Sorcerer, borrowed $100 dollars for 10 years at 2% to help fund research for improved potions, then your interest expense is $2 per year until you pay back the original $100 at the end of 10 years.  Perhaps the expected return on that research is a 3% increase in GSP (Gross Sorcerer Production).  A 3% expected return relative to 2% borrowing cost makes the endeavor worth it.  If you then need to go back to the market to borrow money for another 10 years, but interest rates have risen to 4%, you will now have to service the debt at $4 per year.  The increased interest expense is just that - it is an expense to be weighed against the potential return on investment.  The higher the cost of borrowing, the higher the required return to make investments worth pursuing.  However, if a large part of your budget deficit is from mandatory costs, such as funding the Sorcerer Security Fund and Wizacaid, or in subsidizing local potion powder producers, then you have reduced flexibility in managing your debt expenses.  In other words, without real reform you just have to keep going to the market to borrow from the future to fund current mandatory commitments.  As the largest economy, the market is watching you, though.  And, when it starts to question your management of the debt your are borrowing, it will demand greater assurance that your credit is good.  It will do that by demanding a higher interest rate to lend you money.  Thus begins a vicious cycle, underscoring the importance of a well-run government.</p>

<p>As the Sorcerer, perhaps, the lesson learned is less about lamenting the decision to leave your apprentice unsupervised.  Perhaps, just maybe, it is more about taking care to chose the right apprentice in the first place.  With such a heavy burden on your shoulders to be a force for good in the world, it is those decisions that carry the greatest effect.  As we’ve seen, it takes just one enhanted evening to flood your lair and upend a reputation that’s taken nearly a century to build.</p>

<p>Candidly, my objective for this article was to nerd out on bonds and interest rates with a focus on the U.S. 10-Year T-Note.  Diving into an analysis of tariffs just sort of happened, but seemed like a reasonable foundation to help provide context for the market’s reaction.  So, I just ran with it.  As this article suggests, T-Notes will still be around next month, and I promise to get us back on track then.  Following up with some of the basics of fixed income mechanics should be a good complement to the macro themes we’ve discussed here.</p>
