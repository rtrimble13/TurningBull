"So, there I was," you might say to your buddies at the canteen, if you'll humor me on this one.  Telling war stories long after the sun has set and the drinks have risen is one of humanity's staples, afterall.  Yet, you were there, and this story is yours.  You might have been the son of a slave and spent your formative years working the fields for a Roman landowner.  You might have seen your father cut down over a petty dispute when you were twelve.  And you might have lost your mother and sisters to the plague not long after.  None of that would have shielded you from conscription as a Roman foot soldier in support of < > during the Second Punic War.  

So, there you were on a sweltering sunny day on the outskirts of Cannae, probably somewhere in the middle front of the formation.  This is where the expendable soldiers typically found themselves.  Nothing personal, you've spent a short life acquiring a deep understanding of what it is to be expendable.  At least that day didn't start with a twenty-five mile foot march or exhausting drill with wooden swords.  Your blisters were lanced and your welts, well, at least you didn't earn new ones that day...  

Around you in tight formation were your family-in-arms.  Boys, mostly, not so different from you in almost every way.  To your your front, across the field, stood Hannibal's horde.  They looked like savages.  Perhaps an illusion, but they didn't even appear to be formed in a straight line.  The center of their formation was bowed, and you could hear your sergeant growl that it was a ploy to make their numbers seem larger.  Numbers matter on open fields, and the odds were squarely against them.  

Upon the order to advance, you began a steady march toward contact.  Your view was limited: not only were you not in the front rank, but the dry earth quickly gave way to plumes of dust that lingered in the windless air.  You could see well enough to conclude that they indeed were savages, though.  Lightly armored and apparently not as disciplined, their concave line started to pull back at first contact.  The Roman line was a machine that knew one direction - *forward*.  As the tempo of battle started to quicken, you saw the face of Death, and it was staring at them.  Their casualties seemed to build, and their apparent response was to fall back.  

As the drone of battle roared to the front your section kept up the tempo, and you hadn't even yet swung your sword.  By now, you started minding your steps so as not to trip over bodies that were alive just a few moments ago.  At this pace, you had to keep moving foward since there was an entire army to your back.  But something caught your attention.  There are new sounds of battle besides those to your front.  You looked to your right.  Fellow Romans in your file were fighting on their flank.  Shifting your gaze to the left showed the same.  The dust had hung like a blanket, but your ears could hear what your eyes could not see.  The tempo had just changed, and the battle was now coming for you from both sides.  It was finally time to use that sword.

"During a fight, time loses value.  Seconds feel like minutes, and minutes stand still while Death works at his own pace," you might tell your friends.  But you weren't thinking about that.  You weren't thinking about anything.  You were just reacting to the fight, trying to keep up with the tempo.  All the while, your brothers were slashing and being slashed to your front, sides, and back.  Hannibal had broken your lines, and the only sensible thing to do was begin to fall back.  The face of Death was now looking in your direction.  

"When you no longer control the tempo in a fight, your sense of direction is one of the first things go," you might further explain.  Amid the dust and broken bodies, it was all you could do to guage your bearing based on the direction most of your surviving brothers seemed to be going.  However, you quickly found yourself stuck.  Puzzled, you cursed your fellow Romans to pick up the retreat.  It took just a second, or was it a minute, to discover the reason for the holdup.  Through a momentary break in the dust you caught a glimpse of the area of the field you had marshalled over before the battle.  Where there had been Romans, confident in their numerical superiority, there were now Iberian cavalry racing towards you, blocking any hope for an orderly retreat.  

And, so there you were, with Hannibal's infantry to your front and flanks, and with his cavalry closing in from behind.  Perhaps the only thing you could mutter to yourself was, "Well, I'll be damned..."

### A Lesson In Tempo

![Battle Formation]({{page.image1 | relative_url}})

While Hannibal ultimately lost the Second Punic War, he decicively defeated the Romans at Cannae through a maneurver that became known as a double envelopment.  Whereas an envelopment is a tactical maneuver that consists of attacking an enemy on a flank.  A double envelopement is just more of that, applied to both flanks.  I think, though, that Hannibal's true genious at Cannae was the way in which he lured the Romans into a false sense that they controlled the tempo of the fight.  The concave formation of his front line was deliberately designed to enable the Romans to build forward momentum.  As the Romans pushed foward, that line became convex and allowed the infantry on both sides of the line to pivot inward onto the Roman flanks.  Meanwhile, Hannibal used his cavalry to close in from the rear and prevent a Roman retreat.  The Romans found themselves fighting in every direction, lost their momentum, and were effectively decimated.

### The Magnificent-7

And now for something completely different...  Well, sort of.  I actually believe one can draw an analogy between the Roman experience at Cannae and the influence that a small number of stocks has on the U.S. equities market today.  The **S&P 500**, if you recall from last month, is an index comprised of the largest 500 publicly traded U.S. companies.  It is often seen as a barometer for the equities market.  One of its main features is its market capitalization (market cap) weighting scheme.  Index constituents are selected based on market cap, or the number of shares outstanding (float), multiplied by the current market price per share.  We can think of a company's market cap as its equity market value.  While a market cap-weighted index is arguably better than a price-weighted one like the **DOW** - let's shelve that one for another time - it is definitely worthy of a little investigative scrutiny.  

As of the end of 2024, the S&P 500 (S&P) market cap was hovering around $53Tn.  With the inaguration now in the rearview, the books are open on how durable that $50Tn level remains...  Regardless, the index has had a hell of a run over the last 10 years.  <mkt return and mkt cap growth stats>.  From [last month], we know that means if you had invested $1 in a fund tracking the S&P on Jan 1st, 2015, you would have ~<$$> by December 31st, 2024.  Now, imagine a number larger than $1, and you get the picture.  As that investor in an S&P tracker, though, you might wonder what's driving those gains.  Well, a significant contributor to the success of the U.S. equities market as been *Big Tech*.  

Technology companies have revolutionized not only how we interact with the world - think personal computing, mobile devices, wearables, e-commerce, etc. - but also how the world interacts with us - think social media, automation, personalized marketing, cyber warfare, and so on.  Thanks to technological innovation, the world has accomplished in the past couple of decades what would have taken centuries in other eras.  And then, there's humanity.., but that's besides the point.  As technology has exploded, economic growth has come along for the ride.  So you have the S&P.

As that S&P investor, you might believe those investment returns are the result of tech innovation being shared in a *diversified* manner among all of those 500 largest companies.  Afterall, how much can a few Tech companies really influence the performance of a 500-stock portfolio?  Why not rely on the power of numbers and let their momentum ride?  Well, here's where a little scrutiny of the market cap weighting method becomes useful.  As we discussed above, since the S&P chooses its constituents based on market cap, so long as the market caps of the largest 500 companies in the U.S. equities market are of a similar order of magnitude, then
