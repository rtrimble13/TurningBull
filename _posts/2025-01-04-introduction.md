"That's it," I tell myself.  "Finally going to start that blog," as I finish Palahniuk's *Survivor*.  In truth, I've wanted to do this for a long time.  Now it's 2025, and what better time than the present.  The country has chosen Trump, the stock market is on a tear, the world is playing with matches, and AI is after everyone's job.  

While I have views on each of these topics, they are not my intended focus.  My opinions may show through from time to time, but my intent is to refrain from partisan commentary.  Instead, I'll strive to remain objective and support claims with objective analysis.  

So, what is it that I'd like to accomplish with this blog?  After a lot of deliberation, I think I can summarize my intent most simply in saying that I would like to explore a range of topics relating to quantitative finance, economics and leadership.  Each of these subjects is relevant to our world and intersect in interesting ways.  My goal, thus, is to educate, illuminate, and share my enthusiasm for the ways in which these topics influence us.

Quantitative finance is my trade, and my interests span the field's range.  From markets and securities analysis to portfolio construction and risk management, there is an endless array of topics to explore.  I'll strive to demystify seemingly complex and abstract concepts with a mix of theory and practical examples.  Since programming and data analysis remain integral skillsets to the craft, I'll also strive to include relevant code and visualization techniques.

Economics may be the *dismal science*, but it governs our world in inumerable ways.  Coupling economic analysis with quantitative financial techniques offers a unique and insightful way to understand what is happening around us beyond the headlines.  Much of what occurs at the macro, and even micro, levels is outside of our control.  However, improving our economic understanding can help us make informed decisions.  At the end of the day, it is generally better to be informed than naive.  

Then there's leadership - one of the most underappreciated and misunderstood concepts, in my opinion.  So often we seem to either confuse leadership with hubris or recognize true leadership only in retrospect.  The importance of character in defining leadership is never so apparent as when it is missing.  And for many, leadership is learned by example.  So, when the pool of good leadership examples is limited, the risk of learning the wrong principles is elevated.  We feel the effects of leadership, both good and bad, daily at our own local levels, whether in the classroom, on the atheletic field, or at work.  We are also impacted by the cumulative effects of leadership on macro stage through laws, policies, trade, court decisions, etc.  With so much riding on our *leaders'* decisions, I feel this subject deserves an equal seat at the table.

Finally, "what's with the tank?" you might ask.  Well, although I'm not the punk captain I was nearly 25 years ago, the cavalry still runs through my veins.  And, anyone who's spent time in *the suck* can attest that we all left a part of ourselves in the desert.

I don't have a clue where this will lead, but I'm optimistic that it will be interesting.  It's been a goal of mine for a while, and it felt like the right time to finally cross the line.  This will be a random walk, so to speak.  So, mount up!  Action front!  Let's move out and draw fire!!  Welcome to the TurningBull.
