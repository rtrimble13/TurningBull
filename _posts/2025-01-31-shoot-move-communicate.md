Despite the heat, you're in full battle dress, weighed down with an additional 50lbs of tactical equipment and ammunition.  Your sweat-soaked clothes cling to your body like a toddler testing your patience.  And then there's the mosquitoes.  You are a mosquito magnet - the tastiest one in a long time - and word has gotten to the biting gnats, too.  

Despite all that, you're running late.  Adjacent units are counting on you to clear an objective where the enemy is dug in and expecting you.  As it happens, the terrain seems to be on their side.  After encountering a river that was not on the map and a bog endowed with mines, you need to make up time.

The sounds of distant gunfire and artillery momentarily take you back to the first lesson you learned in Basic: **No excuse!**  You're jolted from your mini daydream as the commander's radioing for your *sitrep*.  By his tone, you know that he know's you're late, too.  You have a time and place to be in 30 minutes, and at this rate, you will be late.

Fortunately, you also have a platoon of the finest cavalry troopers you will ever know who share your sense of urgency.  Adding to your fortune, you are all well versed in the basic language of tactical maneuver.  You are free to improvise and problem solve on the spot because you've drilled the basics of shoot, move and communicate since day 1.

Concepts like *traveling overwatch* and *alternating bounds* are the articles and prepositions of your platoon's maneuver lingua.  It's the stuff that's spoken subconsciously, freeing up cycles to handle novel circumstances.  All of the classroom instruction and field training have led to this moment.  It's a moment where the bullets are real, the mosquitoes are hungry, and you're late....

The title phrase is not exclusive to the military domain.  

### Calculating Simple Returns 



$$
R_t = \frac{V_t - V_0}{V_0} \tag{1}
$$

If you received additional cash flows, or dividends, during the return period, then the expression becomes:

$$
R_t = \frac{V_t + D - V_0}{V_0} \tag{2}
$$
